This repository is for a machine learning study based on the psychology of what is objectively beautiful.
We want to see if we can classify what an individual views as beautiful by using images.
All the data in this study will be collected manually.
The purpose of focusing on the individual is to avoid overall bias.

This project will be submitted as a creative video to the 2023 Spring Duquesne University Undergradutate Research and Scholarship Symposium.
